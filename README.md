My approach to the hands on coding exercises from kodekloud.com "Lab-YAML"

Exercise 1: There is a yaml file named "practice.yaml" under "/home/bob/playbooks/" directory with a key "property1" and value "value1". Add an additional key named "property2" and value "value2". 

Exercise 2: We have updated the "/home/bob/playbooks/practice.yaml" file with the key "name" and value "apple". Add some additional properties (given below) to the dictionary.
name=apple
color=red
weight=90g
